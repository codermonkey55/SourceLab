# QuickSnacks - A sample Catering application

## Summary

This is a simple catering application meant to illustrate my current skills and gain new ones.

## Purpose

This project exists solely to showcase my skills and the learning process of obtaining some of those skills.
It is not meant to be a real-world project.  However, if others can find value in it I welcome its use and any collaboration on the project.

## Goals

Initially, I plan to utilize and demonstrate the use of the following patterns and technologies:

* Test-Driven Development
 * Using nUnit v3.0
* [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc)
* [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api)
* [KnockoutJS](https://www.knockoutjs.com//)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (because I'm not a designer :)
* Microsoft SQL Server for persistence, with data access through:
 * "Raw" ADO.NET
 * Entity Framework
 * NHibernate
* Design with UML
* Domain-Driven Design
 * Bounded Contexts
 * Distinct Entities and Value Objects

### Possible long-term goals

* [SignalR](http://signalr.net/) (for eventual consistency updates)
* Domain-Driven Design
 * CQRS
 * Event Sourcing - especially useful in customer accounts
* Message Queuing (specific technology TBD)
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
 * Using [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/)
* Azure deployment
 * Website
 * Database
* NoSQL objects persistence, with data access through:
  * MongoDB
